App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user 
can enter your app. Some components depend on others.

There are four different types of app components:

- Activities.
- Services.
- Content providers.
- Broadcast receivers.

Activities - An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.
Services - A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons.
Broadcast receivers - A broadcast receiver is a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user
flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.
Content providers - A content provider manages a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, 
on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access.

Activating component
Three of the four component types—activities, services, and broadcast receivers—are activated by an asynchronous message called an intent. 
Intents bind individual components to each other at runtime. You can think of them as the messengers that request an action from other 
components, whether the component belongs to your app or another.
An intent is created with an Intent object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a 
specific type of component (implicit intent).
